* to_sql.py is a toy example of reading and writing data to snowflake using pandas and no SQL

  2. Create a connection to the target Database and Schema
  3. Create a an example .csv file containing the current time
  4. Reads the .csv file into a dataframe
  5. Writes that dataframe to snowflake using the connection built above
  6. Read newly created table into a dataframe
  7. Print dataframe to check that it uploaded the current time
